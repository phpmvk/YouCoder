## **Configuration**

This project requires certain configuration variables to be set in a *'.env'* file. It is used to store sensitive information or configuration variables, and keep it separate from the codebase. Please follow these steps to create your own *'.env'* file:

1. Move into the server directory:

`cd server`

2. Copy the *'example.env'* file to a new file called *'.env'*:

`cp .env.example .env`

3. Replace the placeholder values in *'.env'* with your own values.

- **RAPIDAPI_KEY**: Your [Judge0 API key](https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/pricing).
- ****RAPIDAPI_HOST****: The host url for Judge0 on RapidAPI.
- ****PORT****: The port number that the server should listen on.
- ****DATABASE_URL****: Insert the URL to your Postgresql database.
- ****FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID****: [Generate a private key file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments) for your project on Firebase, and insert the 'project_id' here.
- ****FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL****: Insert your Firebase project 'client_email' here.
- ****FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY****: Insert your Firebase project 'private_key' here.

4. Save the *'.env'* file. Ensure it's in the server directory of the project.

Note: **Do not commit the *'.env'* file to version control!** It will likely contain sensitive information.

5. Install all the relevant dependencies:
`npm install`

## **Scripts**

`npm run build`

- cleans the /build folder if it exists, then builds the app JS there.

`npm run start:dev`

- Runs 'npm run build' then starts the application in development using nodemon and ts-node.

`npm run start`

- Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at build/index.js.

`npm test`

- Runs the included test suite using Jest.
